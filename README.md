# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
â€¢ The objective is to build a machine learning model that can distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.
## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones using a real-world dataset. The dataset contains transaction details such as amount, user ID, merchant information, timestamps, and other related attributes. The key objectives are:

- **Detect Fraudulent Transactions:** Develop a model that minimizes false positives while maximizing the detection of fraudulent activities.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify and extract key transactional attributes that are strong indicators of fraud.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, etc.) on unbalanced data.
